Nations that follow a policy of autarky are characterized by self-sufficiency and limited trade with global partners.\nThe definition of autarky comes from the Greek—autos, meaning \"self\" and arkein, meaning \"to ward off\" and \"to be strong enough, to suffice.\" A fully autarkic nation would be a closed economy and lacking any sources of external support, trade or aid. In practice, however, no modern nation has achieved this level of autarky, even when subjected to punishing sanctions. This is because the global supply chain has made true economic isolation difficult, so any policy of autarky is a matter of degrees rather than a complete isolation.\nKey Takeaways\nAutarky refers to the state of self-sufficiency and is typically used to describe nations or economies that have the goal of reducing their dependence on international trade.\nThere are no fully-autarkic nations in the modern world, as even the most isolated have some level of participation in international trade and receive outside support or aid.\n",

The primary goal is to remove centralized intermediaries like exchanges, which potentially simplifies trading. Atomic swaps reduce the number of trades needed by consolidating transactions into one.\nThe term atomic derives from the term \"atomic state\" in which a state has no substates. This refers to a cryptocurrency transaction between two people using different blockchains that either happens or it doesn't—there are no alternatives.\nMost atomic swap-enabled\nwallets\nand blockchains use smart contracts. Smart contracts are blockchain programs that execute when specific conditions are met. In this case, the conditions are that each party agrees to the transaction before a timer runs out. Using a smart contract in the trade prevents either party from stealing a cryptocurrency from the other.\nAtomic swaps are also called\ncross-chain\natomic swaps.\nKey Takeaways\nAtomic swaps enable direct cryptocurrency exchanges across different blockchains without intermediaries.\n",

Begen\nNetworked Media\nRFC 8680\nForward Error Correction (FEC) Framework Extension to Sliding Window Codes\nAbstract\nRFC 6363 describes a framework for using Forward Error Correction (FEC)\ncodes to provide protection against packet loss. The framework\nsupports applying FEC to arbitrary packet flows over unreliable\ntransport and is primarily intended for real-time, or streaming, media.\nHowever, FECFRAME as per RFC 6363 is restricted to block FEC codes.\nThis document updates RFC 6363 to support FEC codes based on a\nsliding encoding window, in addition to block FEC codes, in a\nbackward-compatible way.\nDuring multicast/broadcast real-time content delivery, the use of\nsliding window codes significantly improves robustness in harsh\nenvironments, with less repair traffic and lower FEC-related added latency.\n",

The simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network and thus improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to network failure.\n¶\nMultipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple\n      paths between peers. This document presents a set of extensions to\n      traditional TCP to support multipath operation. The protocol offers the\n      same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e., a reliable bytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.\n",

Strong growth, high tax or sales revenue, and a drop in spending can all lead to a budget surplus. The surplus can be used to pay for research, new projects, or existing debt. A surplus can be risky, though, as businesses are less likely to invest when the economy is strong.

AI is seemingly everywhere—yet it's also entangled in a mess of buzzwords and grand promises.\nIn many ways, AI is a transformative technology. But when we look back on history, its promises and challenges are not all that unique. History teaches us that technology implementation is always complex and rarely goes as planned.\nAs my teammate\nMark Anthony Hoffman\nrecently shared at Gartner's 2024 Digital Workplace Summit, technology resistance is an age-old phenomenon. Plato and Socrates warned against the pen, arguing it induced forgetfulness in the learners' souls and minds and that knowledge should be spoken and remembered. Almost 2,000 years later, in 1440, Gutenberg invented the printing press. The new technology made the written word widely available, but it also eliminated the jobs of scribes, who lived and profited from Plato's detested pen.
