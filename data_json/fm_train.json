Antoni\n: “This GDP report, I mean, really, is an absolute blockbuster. It completely defies expectation. It is not only a good headline number, it has good internals, as well.”\nEconomist Steve Moore\n: “This is an amazing number … We’re seeing lots of jobs. We’re seeing tame inflation. It is really a beautiful picture … It’s hard to see anything to complain about. I’m sure Democrats will find something they don’t like.”\nBullseye Brief author Adam Johnson\n: “The GDP Price Index was only 2% and the expectation was 2.2%. In other words, we have an economy growing at 3%; we have inflation at 2%. That’s the best of both words, so I’m very positive on that report.”\n",

Tax reform created a 20% deduction to allow these small businesses to compete on a level playing field with their peers organized as corporations … The pass-through deduction will expire completely at the end of 2025. A recent NAM survey found that 93% of pass-through manufacturers reported that the loss of this deduction will harm their ability to grow, create jobs and invest in their business.”\n",

The topics include differentiable rendering/neural rendering, BRDF estimation, texture synthesis, denoising, procedural modeling, view synthesis, colorization, style transfer, motion synthesis, differentiable physics simulation, and reinforcement learning. Through programming projects and homework, students who successfully complete this course will be able to use neural rendering algorithms for image manipulation, apply neural procedural modeling for shape and scene synthesis, exploit data-driven methods for simulating physical phenomena, and implement policy learning algorithms for creating character animation.

(2) A quarter-long \"quantified self\" project where\nstudents identify a set of questions about themselves or their surroundings,\ncollect data to answer the questions, and analyze and visualize the collected\ndata. (3) A set of guest speakers, including some who focus on the \"doubts\" of\ncollecting and exploiting data, such as questions of ethics, bias, and privacy.\n\n## Section 4\n\nIn addition to the course project, students will complete short assignments to\npractice the learned tools and techniques, and will be expected to do some\nreadings in advance of each guest speaker and engage in thoughtful discussion.\n",

We apply it to the task of instance selection in distant supervision. Modeling the instance selection in one bag as a sequential decision process, a reinforcement learning agent is trained to determine whether an instance is valuable or not and construct a new bag with less noisy instances. However unbiased methods, such as REINFORCE, could usually take much time to train.

In this work, we propose a new light-weight benchmark task called Diner Dash for evaluating the performance in a complicated task with high dimensional action space. In contrast to the traditional Atari games that only have a flat structure of goals and very few actions, the proposed benchmark task has a hierarchical task structure and size of 57 for the action space and hence can facilitate the development of policy learning in complicated tasks. On top of that, we introduce Decomposed Policy Graph Modelling (DPGM), an algorithm that combines both graph modelling and deep learning to allow explicit domain knowledge embedding and achieves significant improvement comparing to the baseline. In the experiments, we have shown the effectiveness of the domain knowledge injection via a specially designed imitation algorithm as well as results of other popular algorithms.\n",

For collaborative assembly tasks with humans, robots require further cognitive capabilities, such as commonsense reasoning, sensing, and communication skills, not only to cope with the uncertainty caused by incomplete knowledge about the humans' behaviors but also to ensure safer collaborations. We propose a novel method for collaborative assembly planning under uncertainty, that utilizes hybrid conditional planning extended with commonsense reasoning and a rich set of communication actions for collaborative tasks. Our method is based on answer set programming.

However, focusing on dataset-specific biases limits their ability to learn more generalizable knowledge about the task from more general data patterns. In this paper, we investigate the impact of debiasing methods for improving generalization and propose a general framework for improving the performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets by concurrent modeling of multiple biases in the training data. Our framework weights each example based on the biases it contains and the strength of those biases in the training data. It then uses these weights in the training objective so that the model relies less on examples with high bias weights. We extensively evaluate our framework on extractive question answering with training data from various domains with multiple biases of different strengths. We perform the evaluations in two different settings, in which the model is trained on a single domain or multiple domains simultaneously, and show its effectiveness in both settings compared to state-of-the-art debiasing methods.\n",

In this project we sought to build a BDI agent for use in the real world for campus mail delivery in the tunnel system at Carleton University. Ideally, the robot should receive a delivery order via a mobile application, pick up the mail at a station, navigate the tunnels to the destination station, and notify the recipient.\n  We linked the Robot Operating System (ROS) with a BDI reasoning system to achieve a subset of the required use cases. ROS handles the low-level sensing and actuation, while the BDI reasoning system handles the high-level reasoning and decision making. Sensory data is orchestrated and sent from ROS to the reasoning system as perceptions.

There are multiple datasets for evaluating NLP Interpretability, but their dependence on human provided ground truths raises questions about their unbiasedness. In this work, we take a different approach and formulate a specific classification task by diverting question-answering datasets. For this custom classification task, the interpretability ground-truth arises directly from the definition of the classification problem.

In addition to the lack of annotated data, low benchmarking is still a major reason for slow progress. In order to fill this gap, we compare multiple existing entity and relation extraction models over a recently introduced public dataset, BioRelEx of sentences annotated with biological entities and relations.

We introduce a challenging real-time strategy game environment in which the actions of a large number of units must be coordinated across long time scales. We gather a dataset of 76 thousand pairs of instructions and executions from human play, and train instructor and executor models.

Their 'black box' way of classifying medical images into anomaly labels poses problems for their acceptance, particularly with clinicians. Current explainable AI methods offer justifications through visualizations such as heat maps but cannot guarantee that the network is focusing on the relevant image region fully containing the anomaly. In this paper, we develop an approach to explainable AI in which the anomaly is assured to be overlapping the expected location when present. This is made possible by automatically extracting location-specific labels from textual reports and learning the association of expected locations to labels using a hybrid combination of Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (Bi-LSTM) and DenseNet-121. Use of this expected location to bias the subsequent attention-guided inference network based on ResNet101 results in the isolation of the anomaly at the expected location when present. The method is evaluated on a large chest X-ray dataset.\n",

We use a CRNN previously proposed for the localization and detection of stationary sources, and show that the recurrent layers enable the spatial tracking of moving sources when trained with dynamic scenes. The tracking performance of the CRNN is compared with a stand-alone tracking method that combines a multi-source (DOA) estimator and a particle filter. Their respective performance is evaluated in various acoustic conditions such as anechoic and reverberant scenarios, stationary and moving sources at several angular velocities, and with a varying number of overlapping sources. The results show that the CRNN manages to track multiple sources more consistently than the parametric method across acoustic scenarios, but at the cost of higher localization error.\n",

This prevents robust applications of RL in real world situations, where system dynamics may deviate wildly from the training settings. In this work, our primary contribution is to propose an information theoretic regularization objective and an annealing-based optimization method to achieve better generalization ability in RL agents. We demonstrate the extreme generalization benefits of our approach in different domains ranging from maze navigation to robotic tasks; for the first time, we show that agents can generalize to test parameters more than 10 standard deviations away from the training parameter distribution. This work provides a principled way to improve generalization in RL by gradually removing information that is redundant for task-solving; it opens doors for the systematic study of generalization from training to extremely different testing settings, focusing on the established connections between information theory and machine learning.\n",

As clinical data are complex and varied in their structure and components, continued innovation of modeling strategies is required to identify architectures that can best model outcomes. In this work, we train a Heterogeneous Graph Model (HGM) on Electronic Health Record data and use the resulting embedding vector as additional information added to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for predicting in-hospital mortality. We show that the additional information provided by including time as a vector in the embedding captures the relationships between medical concepts, lab tests, and diagnoses, which enhances predictive performance. We find that adding HGM to a CNN model increases the mortality prediction accuracy up to 4\\%. This framework serves as a foundation for future experiments involving different EHR data types on important healthcare prediction tasks.\n",

Explainable recommendation systems, in particular, may suffer from both explanation bias and performance disparity. In this paper, we analyze different groups of users according to their level of activity, and find that bias exists in recommendation performance between different groups. We show that inactive users may be more susceptible to receiving unsatisfactory recommendations, due to insufficient training data for the inactive users, and that their recommendations may be biased by the training records of more active users, due to the nature of collaborative filtering, which leads to an unfair treatment by the system. We propose a fairness constrained approach via heuristic re-ranking to mitigate this unfairness problem in the context of explainable recommendation over knowledge graphs. We experiment on several real-world datasets with state-of-the-art knowledge graph-based explainable recommendation algorithms. The promising results show that our algorithm is not only able to provide high-quality explainable recommendations, but also reduces the recommendation unfairness in several respects.\n",

This will result in saving the time and the effort and enhancing the customer feedback and improving the business.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm, SNO-MDP, that explores and optimizes Markov decision processes under unknown safety constraints. Specifically, we take a stepwise approach for optimizing safety and cumulative reward. In our method, the agent first learns safety constraints by expanding the safe region, and then optimizes the cumulative reward in the certified safe region. We provide theoretical guarantees on both the satisfaction of the safety constraint and the near-optimality of the cumulative reward under proper regularity assumptions. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SNO-MDP through two experiments: one uses a synthetic data in a new, openly-available environment named GP-SAFETY-GYM, and the other simulates Mars surface exploration by using real observation data.\n",

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-known technique for learning such policies. However, current RL algorithms often have to deal with reward shaping, have difficulties generalizing to other environments and are most often sample inefficient. In this paper, we explore active inference and the free energy principle, a normative theory from neuroscience that explains how self-organizing biological systems operate by maintaining a model of the world and casting action selection as an inference problem. We apply this concept to a typical problem known to the RL community, the mountain car problem, and show how active inference encompasses both RL and learning from demonstrations.\n",

The weights decays inverse proportionally with the iteration times. Stochastic gradient descent with momentum (Sgdm) use weights that decays exponentially with the iteration times to generate an momentum term. Using exponentially decaying weights, variants of Sgdm with well designed and complicated formats have been proposed to achieve better performance. The momentum update rules of our method is as simple as that of Sgdm. We provide theoretical convergence properties analyses for our method, which show both the exponentially decay weights and our inverse proportionally decay weights can limit the variance of the moving direction of parameters to be optimized to a region. Experimental results empirically show that our method works well with practical problems and outperforms Sgdm, and it outperforms Adam in convolutional neural networks.\n",

Moreover, prior works rarely leverage unlabeled data in the target language, which can be effortlessly collected and potentially contains valuable information for improved results. To handle both problems, we propose a novel approach termed UniTrans to Unify both model and data Transfer for cross-lingual NER, and furthermore, to leverage the available information from unlabeled target-language data via enhanced knowledge distillation.

Eliceiri']\nSource: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05538v1\n\nAbstract: Dual-stream Maximum Self-attention Multi-instance Learning\n\nMulti-instance learning (MIL) is a form of weakly supervised learning where a single class label is assigned to a bag of instances while the instance-level labels are not available. Training classifiers to accurately determine the bag label and instance labels is a challenging but critical task in many practical scenarios, such as computational histopathology. Recently, MIL models fully parameterized by neural networks have become popular due to the high flexibility and superior performance. Most of these models rely on attention mechanisms that assign attention scores across the instance embeddings in a bag and produce the bag embedding using an aggregation operator. In this paper, we proposed a dual-stream maximum self-attention MIL model (DSMIL) parameterized by neural networks. The first stream deploys a simple MIL max-pooling while the top-activated instance embedding is determined and used to obtain self-attention scores across instance embeddings in the second stream. Different from most of the previous methods, the proposed model jointly learns an instance classifier and a bag classifier based on the same instance embeddings. The experiments results show that our method achieves superior performance compared to the best MIL methods and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on benchmark MIL datasets.\n",

Consequently, with greater or lesser success, optimal filterbank learning has been studied for different speech processing tasks. In this paper, we fill in a gap by exploring filterbank learning for keyword spotting (KWS). Two approaches are examined: filterbank matrix learning in the power spectral domain and parameter learning of a psychoacoustically-motivated gammachirp filterbank. Filterbank parameters are optimized jointly with a modern deep residual neural network-based KWS back-end.

However, due to their inherent opaqueness, some recently raised concerns about using neural models are starting to be taken seriously. In fact, intentional or unintentional behaviors could lead to a dialogue system to generate inappropriate responses. Thus, in this paper, we investigate whether we can learn to craft input sentences that result in a black-box neural dialogue model being manipulated into having its outputs contain target words or match target sentences. We propose a reinforcement learning based model that can generate such desired inputs automatically. Extensive experiments on a popular well-trained state-of-the-art neural dialogue model show that our method can successfully seek out desired inputs that lead to the target outputs in a considerable portion of cases.

Learning latent representations of discourse is an attractive alternative to acquiring expensive labeled discourse data. Liu and Lapata (2018) propose a structured attention mechanism for text classification that derives a tree over a text, akin to an RST discourse tree. We examine this model in detail, and evaluate on additional discourse-relevant tasks and datasets, in order to assess whether the structured attention improves performance on the end task and whether it captures a text's discourse structure. We find the learned latent trees have little to no structure and instead focus on lexical cues; even after obtaining more structured trees with proposed model modifications, the trees are still far from capturing discourse structure when compared to discourse dependency trees from an existing discourse parser. Finally, ablation studies show the structured attention provides little benefit, sometimes even hurting performance.\n",

In the last few years, these methods have become extremely popular as a replacement for manual feature engineering. Since authors use various approaches for the evaluation of node embedding methods, existing studies can rarely be efficiently and accurately compared. We address this issue by developing a process for a fair and objective evaluation of node embedding procedures w.r.t. node classification. This process supports researchers and practitioners to compare new and existing methods in a reproducible way. We apply this process to four popular node embedding methods and make valuable observations. With an appropriate combination of hyperparameters, good performance can be achieved even with embeddings of lower dimensions, which is positive for the run times of the downstream machine learning task and the embedding algorithm. Multiple hyperparameter combinations yield similar performance. Thus, no extensive, time-consuming search is required to achieve reasonable performance in most cases.\n",

Our working hypothesis is that, due to its temporal stability, an agent's body produces more consistent sensory experiences than the environment, which exhibits a greater variability. Given its motor experience, an agent can thus reliably predict what appearance its body should have. This intrinsic predictability can be used to automatically isolate the body image from the rest of the environment. We propose a two-branches deconvolutional neural network to predict the visual sensory state associated with an input motor state, as well as the prediction error associated with this input. We train the network on a dataset of first-person images collected with a simulated Pepper robot, and show how the network outputs can be used to automatically isolate its visible arm from the rest of the environment. Finally, the quality of the body image produced by the network is evaluated.\n",

This work proposes an autoregressive model with sub-linear parallel time generation. Noting that conditional random fields with bounded context can be decoded in parallel, we propose an efficient cascaded decoding approach for generating high-quality output. To parameterize this cascade, we introduce a Markov transformer, a variant of the popular fully autoregressive model that allows us to simultaneously decode with specific autoregressive context cutoffs. This approach requires only a small modification from standard autoregressive training, while showing competitive accuracy/speed tradeoff compared to existing methods on five machine translation datasets.\n",

This paper proposes an intelligent method for requirements engineering from natural language and their chaining toward CAD models. The transition from linguistic analysis to the representation of engineering requirements consists of the translation of the syntactic structure into semantic form represented by conceptual graphs. Based on the isomorphism between conceptual graphs and predicate logic, a formal language of the specification is proposed. The outcome of this language is chained and translated in Computer Aided Three-Dimensional Interactive Application (CATIA) models.

To accommodate a wide variety of products, many automated systems include multiple gripper types and/or tool changers. However, for some objects, sequential grasp failures are common: when a computed grasp fails to lift and remove the object, the bin is often left unchanged; as the sensor input is consistent, the system retries the same grasp over and over, resulting in a significant reduction in mean successful picks per hour (MPPH). Based on an empirical study of sequential failures, we characterize a class of \"sequential failure objects\" (SFOs) -- objects prone to sequential failures based on a novel taxonomy. We then propose three non-Markov picking policies that incorporate memory of past failures to modify subsequent actions. Simulation experiments on SFO models and the EGAD dataset suggest that the non-Markov policies significantly outperform the Markov policy in terms of the sequential failure rate and MPPH. In physical experiments on 50 heaps of 12 SFOs the most effective Non-Markov policy increased MPPH over the Dex-Net Markov policy by 107%.\n",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for KG entity typing which is trained by jointly utilizing local typing knowledge from existing entity type assertions and global triple knowledge from KGs. Specifically, we present two distinct knowledge-driven effective mechanisms of entity type inference. Accordingly, we build two novel embedding models to realize the mechanisms. Afterward, a joint model with them is used to infer missing entity type instances, which favors inferences that agree with both entity type instances and triple knowledge in KGs.

Petrick']\nSource: https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04165v2\n\nAbstract: Proof-Carrying Plans: a Resource Logic for AI Planning\n\nRecent trends in AI verification and Explainable AI have raised the question of whether AI planning techniques can be verified. In this paper, we present a novel resource logic, the Proof Carrying Plans (PCP) logic that can be used to verify plans produced by AI planners. The PCP logic takes inspiration from existing resource logics (such as Linear logic and Separation logic) as well as Hoare logic when it comes to modelling states and resource-aware plan execution. It also capitalises on the Curry-Howard approach to logics, in its treatment of plans as functions and plan pre- and post-conditions as types. This paper presents two main results. From the theoretical perspective, we show that the PCP logic is sound relative to the standard possible world semantics used in AI planning. From the practical perspective, we present a complete Agda formalisation of the PCP logic and of its soundness proof. Moreover, we showcase the Curry-Howard, or functional, value of this implementation by supplementing it with the library that parses AI plans into Agda's proofs automatically. We provide evaluation of this library and the resulting Agda functions.\n",

To this end, existing solutions often require full knowledge of the network state, while ignoring the privacy issues and overlooking the non-cooperative behaviors of users. What is more, they may fall short in the face of unexpected failures such as user unavailability and virtual machine breakdown. In this paper, we formulate the problem of service chain composition in NFV systems with failures as a non-cooperative game. By showing that such a game is a weighted potential game and exploiting the unique problem structure, we propose two effective distributed schemes that guide the service chain compositions of different NSs towards the Nash equilibrium (NE) state with both near-optimal latencies and minimum congestion. Besides, we develop two novel learning-aided schemes as comparisons, which are based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) techniques, respectively.

In particular, several Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods have been proposed to discover the connection between CNN's decision and image regions. In spite of the reasonable visualization, lack of clear and sufficient theoretical support is the main limitation of these methods. In this paper, we introduce two axioms -- Conservation and Sensitivity -- to the visualization paradigm of the CAM methods. Meanwhile, a dedicated Axiom-based Grad-CAM (XGrad-CAM) is proposed to satisfy these axioms as much as possible. Experiments demonstrate that XGrad-CAM is an enhanced version of Grad-CAM in terms of conservation and sensitivity. It is able to achieve better visualization performance than Grad-CAM, while also be class-discriminative and easy-to-implement compared with Grad-CAM++ and Ablation-CAM. The code is available at https://github.com/Fu0511/XGrad-CAM.\n",

Recent research approaches conversational search by simplified settings of response ranking and conversational question answering, where an answer is either selected from a given candidate set or extracted from a given passage. These simplifications neglect the fundamental role of retrieval in conversational search. To address this limitation, we introduce an open-retrieval conversational question answering (ORConvQA) setting, where we learn to retrieve evidence from a large collection before extracting answers, as a further step towards building functional conversational search systems. We create a dataset, OR-QuAC, to facilitate research on ORConvQA. We build an end-to-end system for ORConvQA, featuring a retriever, a reranker, and a reader that are all based on Transformers. Our extensive experiments on OR-QuAC demonstrate that a learnable retriever is crucial for ORConvQA. We further show that our system can make a substantial improvement when we enable history modeling in all system components. Moreover, we show that the reranker component contributes to the model performance by providing a regularization effect. Finally, further in-depth analyses are performed to provide new insights into ORConvQA.\n",

As human testing is inefficient and expensive, automated software testing is needed. In this work, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for functional software testing named DRIFT. DRIFT operates on the symbolic representation of the user interface. It uses Q-learning through Batch-RL and models the state-action value function with a Graph Neural Network. We apply DRIFT to testing the Windows 10 operating system and show that DRIFT can robustly trigger the desired software functionality in a fully automated manner.

It is not scalable to develop a new centralized agent every time a task's difficulty outpaces a single agent's abilities. While multi-agent collaboration research has flourished in gridworld-like environments, relatively little work has considered visually rich domains. Addressing this, we introduce the novel task FurnMove in which agents work together to move a piece of furniture through a living room to a goal. Unlike existing tasks, FurnMove requires agents to coordinate at every timestep. We identify two challenges when training agents to complete FurnMove: existing decentralized action sampling procedures do not permit expressive joint action policies and, in tasks requiring close coordination, the number of failed actions dominates successful actions. To confront these challenges we introduce SYNC-policies (synchronize your actions coherently) and CORDIAL (coordination loss). Using SYNC-policies and CORDIAL, our agents achieve a 58% completion rate on FurnMove, an impressive absolute gain of 25 percentage points over competitive decentralized baselines.

PFCM algorithm deals with the weaknesses of FCM in handling noise sensitivity and the weaknesses of PCM in the case of coincidence clusters. However, the PFCM algorithm can be only applied to cluster complete data sets. Therefore, in this study, we propose a modification of the PFCM algorithm that can be applied to incomplete data sets clustering. We modified the PFCM algorithm to OCSPFCM and NPSPFCM algorithms and measured performance on three things: 1) accuracy percentage, 2) a number of iterations to termination, and 3) centroid errors.

Although their performance is promising, the reliance on linguistic tools results in a non end-to-end process. In this work, we propose a novel model, the Self-determined Graph Convolutional Network (SGCN), which determines a weighted graph using a self-attention mechanism, rather using any linguistic tool. Then, the self-determined graph is encoded using a GCN. We test our model on the TACRED dataset and achieve the state-of-the-art result.

An integration architecture tactic to guard AI-first components\n\nIntelligent services provide the power of AI to developers via simple RESTful API endpoints, abstracting away many complexities of machine learning. However, most of these intelligent services-such as computer vision-continually learn with time. When the internals within the abstracted 'black box' become hidden and evolve, pitfalls emerge in the robustness of applications that depend on these evolving services. Without adapting the way developers plan and construct projects reliant on intelligent services, significant gaps and risks result in both project planning and development. Therefore, how can software engineers best mitigate software evolution risk moving forward, thereby ensuring that their own applications maintain quality? Our proposal is an architectural tactic designed to improve intelligent service-dependent software robustness. The tactic involves creating an application-specific benchmark dataset baselined against an intelligent service, enabling evolutionary behaviour changes to be mitigated. A technical evaluation of our implementation of this architecture demonstrates how the tactic can identify 1,054 cases of substantial confidence evolution and 2,461 cases of substantial changes to response label sets using a dataset consisting of 331 images that evolve when sent to a service.\n",

Clustering-based diarization methods partition frames into clusters of the number of speakers; thus, they typically cannot handle overlapping speech because each frame is assigned to one speaker. On the other hand, some end-to-end diarization methods can handle overlapping speech by treating the problem as multi-label classification. Although some methods can treat a flexible number of speakers, they do not perform well when the number of speakers is large. To compensate for each other's weakness, we propose to use a two-speaker end-to-end diarization method as post-processing of the results obtained by a clustering-based method. We iteratively select two speakers from the results and update the results of the two speakers to improve the overlapped region. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm consistently improved the performance of the state-of-the-art methods across CALLHOME, AMI, and DIHARD II datasets.\n",

In this paper, I implemented a model with Bi-directional attention flow layer, connected with a Multi-layer LSTM encoder, connected with one start-index decoder and one conditioning end-index decoder. I introduce a new end-index decoder layer, conditioning on start-index output. The Experiment shows this has increased model performance by 15.16%. For prediction, I proposed a new smart-span equation, rewarding both short answer length and high probability in start-index and end-index, which further improved the prediction accuracy. The best single model achieves an F1 score of 73.97% and EM score of 64.95% on test set.\n",

We propose two new games with concealed information and complex, non-transitive reward structure (think rock/paper/scissors). It turns out that most current deep reinforcement learning methods fail to efficiently explore the strategy space, thus learning policies that generalise poorly to unseen opponents. We then propose a novel hierarchical agent architecture, where the hierarchy is grounded in the game-theoretic structure of the game -- the top level chooses strategic responses to opponents, while the low level implements them into policy over primitive actions. This grounding facilitates credit assignment across the levels of hierarchy. Our experiments show that the proposed hierarchical agent is capable of generalisation to unseen opponents, while conventional baselines fail to generalise whatsoever.\n",

The CA-robot is designed to explore formulations in an open-ended way with no explicit optimization target. By applying the CA-robot to the study of self-propelling multicomponent oil-in-water droplets, we are able to observe an order of magnitude more variety of droplet behaviours than possible with a random parameter search and given the same budget. We demonstrate that the CA-robot enabled the discovery of a sudden and highly specific response of droplets to slight temperature changes. Six modes of self-propelled droplets motion were identified and classified using a time-temperature phase diagram and probed using a variety of techniques including NMR. This work illustrates how target free search can significantly increase the rate of unpredictable observations leading to new discoveries with potential applications in formulation chemistry.\n",

ESD identifies grammatically incorrect text spans with an efficient sequence tagging model. Then, ESC leverages a seq2seq model to take the sentence with annotated erroneous spans as input and only outputs the corrected text for these spans.

Towards learning diversified representations, a new approach, termed Information Competing Process (ICP), is proposed in this paper. Aiming to enrich the information carried by feature representations, ICP separates a representation into two parts with different mutual information constraints. The separated parts are forced to accomplish the downstream task independently in a competitive environment which prevents the two parts from learning what each other learned for the downstream task. Such competing parts are then combined synergistically to complete the task. By fusing representation parts learned competitively under different conditions, ICP facilitates obtaining diversified representations which contain rich information. Experiments on image classification and image reconstruction tasks demonstrate the great potential of ICP to learn discriminative and disentangled representations in both supervised and self-supervised learning settings.\n",

Autonomous driving is a fundamental measure for solving this problem, and track detection is one of the key technologies for computer vision to achieve downhole automatic driving. The track detection result based on the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm lacks the detailed and unique description of the object and relies too much on visual postprocessing technology. Therefore, this paper proposes a track detection algorithm based on a multiscale conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). The generator is decomposed into global and local parts using a multigranularity structure in the generator network. A multiscale shared convolution structure is adopted in the discriminator network to further supervise training the generator. Finally, the Monte Carlo search technique is introduced to search the intermediate state of the generator, and the result is sent to the discriminator for comparison. Compared with the existing work, our model achieved 82.43\\% pixel accuracy and an average intersection-over-union (IOU) of 0.6218, and the detection of the track reached 95.01\\% accuracy in the downhole roadway scene test set.\n",

Their biggest downside is the amount of exploration they require before yielding high-performing policies. In a lifelong learning setting, in which an agent is faced with multiple consecutive tasks over its lifetime, reusing information from previously seen tasks can substantially accelerate the learning of new tasks. We provide a novel method for lifelong policy gradient learning that trains lifelong function approximators directly via policy gradients, allowing the agent to benefit from accumulated knowledge throughout the entire training process. We show empirically that our algorithm learns faster and converges to better policies than single-task and lifelong learning baselines, and completely avoids catastrophic forgetting on a variety of challenging domains.\n",

Particularly concerning are models with inconsistent performance on specific subgroups of a class, e.g., exhibiting disparities in skin cancer classification in the presence or absence of a spurious bandage. To mitigate these performance differences, we introduce model patching, a two-stage framework for improving robustness that encourages the model to be invariant to subgroup differences, and focus on class information shared by subgroups. Model patching first models subgroup features within a class and learns semantic transformations between them, and then trains a classifier with data augmentations that deliberately manipulate subgroup features. We instantiate model patching with CAMEL, which (1) uses a CycleGAN to learn the intra-class, inter-subgroup augmentations, and (2) balances subgroup performance using a theoretically-motivated subgroup consistency regularizer, accompanied by a new robust objective. We demonstrate CAMEL's effectiveness on 3 benchmark datasets, with reductions in robust error of up to 33% relative to the best baseline. Lastly, CAMEL successfully patches a model that fails due to spurious features on a real-world skin cancer dataset.\n",

Currently, there are three promising E2E methods: recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T), RNN attention-based encoder-decoder (AED), and Transformer-AED. In this study, we conduct an empirical comparison of RNN-T, RNN-AED, and Transformer-AED models, in both non-streaming and streaming modes. We use 65 thousand hours of Microsoft anonymized training data to train these models. As E2E models are more data hungry, it is better to compare their effectiveness with large amount of training data. To the best of our knowledge, no such comprehensive study has been conducted yet. We show that although AED models are stronger than RNN-T in the non-streaming mode, RNN-T is very competitive in streaming mode if its encoder can be properly initialized. Among all three E2E models, transformer-AED achieved the best accuracy in both streaming and non-streaming mode. We show that both streaming RNN-T and transformer-AED models can obtain better accuracy than a highly-optimized hybrid model.\n",

To account for potential hierarchical topic structures, hierarchical topic models generalize flat topic models by incorporating latent topic hierarchies into their generative modeling process. However, due to their purely unsupervised nature, the learned topic hierarchy often deviates from users' particular needs or interests. To guide the hierarchical topic discovery process with minimal user supervision, we propose a new task, Hierarchical Topic Mining, which takes a category tree described by category names only, and aims to mine a set of representative terms for each category from a text corpus to help a user comprehend his/her interested topics. We develop a novel joint tree and text embedding method along with a principled optimization procedure that allows simultaneous modeling of the category tree structure and the corpus generative process in the spherical space for effective category-representative term discovery.

In this paper, we approach this challenge through the following invariance principle: an agent must find a representation such that there exists an action-predictor built on top of this representation that is simultaneously optimal across all training domains. Intuitively, the resulting invariant policy enhances generalization by finding causes of successful actions. We propose a novel learning algorithm, Invariant Policy Optimization (IPO), that implements this principle and learns an invariant policy during training. We compare our approach with standard policy gradient methods and demonstrate significant improvements in generalization performance on unseen domains for linear quadratic regulator and grid-world problems, and an example where a robot must learn to open doors with varying physical properties.\n",

Since in a majority of settings paired supervision is not available, much work focuses on Unsupervised Domain Translation (UDT) where data samples from each domain are unpaired. Following the seminal work of CycleGAN for UDT, many variants and extensions of this model have been proposed. However, there is still little theoretical understanding behind their success. We observe that these methods yield solutions which are approximately minimal w.r.t. a given transportation cost, leading us to reformulate the problem in the Optimal Transport (OT) framework. This viewpoint gives us a new perspective on Unsupervised Domain Translation and allows us to prove the existence and uniqueness of the retrieved mapping, given a large family of transport costs. We then propose a novel framework to efficiently compute optimal mappings in a dynamical setting. We show that it generalizes previous methods and enables a more explicit control over the computed optimal mapping. It also provides smooth interpolations between the two domains. Experiments on toy and real world datasets illustrate the behavior of our method.\n",

To exploit sequential simplifications, we present the Quotient-space Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (QRRT) algorithm. QRRT takes as input a start and a goal configuration, and a sequence of quotient-spaces. The algorithm grows trees on the quotient-spaces both sequentially and simultaneously to guarantee a dense coverage. QRRT is shown to be (1) probabilistically complete, and (2) can reduce the runtime by at least one order of magnitude. However, we show in experiments that the runtime varies substantially between different quotient-space sequences. To find out why, we perform an additional experiment, showing that the more narrow an environment, the more a quotient-space sequence can reduce runtime.\n",

Neuromorphic architectures demonstrating such versatility can greatly enhance our ability to efficiently process information at the edge. A key challenge, however, is to understand which learning rules are best suited for specific tasks and how the relevant hyperparameters can be fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a conceptual framework in which the learning process is integrated into the network itself. This allows us to cast meta-learning as a mathematical optimization problem. We employ DeepHyper, a scalable, asynchronous model-based search, to simultaneously optimize the choice of meta-learning rules and their hyperparameters. We demonstrate our approach with two different datasets, MNIST and FashionMNIST, using a network architecture inspired by the learning center of the insect brain. Our results show that optimal learning rules can be dataset-dependent even within similar tasks. This dependency demonstrates the importance of introducing versatility and flexibility in the learning algorithms. It also illuminates experimental findings in insect neuroscience that have shown a heterogeneity of learning rules within the insect mushroom body.\n",

The vanilla transformer is proposed for uni-modal language generation task such as machine translation. However, video captioning is a multimodal learning problem, and the video features have much redundancy between different time steps. Based on these concerns, we propose a novel method called sparse boundary-aware transformer (SBAT) to reduce the redundancy in video representation. SBAT employs boundary-aware pooling operation for scores from multihead attention and selects diverse features from different scenarios. Also, SBAT includes a local correlation scheme to compensate for the local information loss brought by sparse operation. Based on SBAT, we further propose an aligned cross-modal encoding scheme to boost the multimodal interaction. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that SBAT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under most of the metrics.\n",

The bias causes the architecture parameters of non-learnable operations to surpass that of learnable operations. Moreover, using softmax as architecture parameters' activation function and inappropriate learning rate would exacerbate the bias. As a result, it's frequently observed that non-learnable operations are dominated in the search phase. To reduce the bias, we propose to use single-level to replace bi-level optimization and non-competitive activation function like sigmoid to replace softmax. As a result, we could search high-performance architectures steadily. Experiments on NAS Benchmark 201 validate our hypothesis and stably find out nearly the optimal architecture. On DARTS space, we search the state-of-the-art architecture with 77.0% top1 accuracy (training setting follows PDARTS and without any additional module) on ImageNet-1K and steadily search architectures up-to 76.5% top1 accuracy (but not select the best from the searched architectures) which is comparable with current reported best result.\n",

In many cases we can give completely rigorous answers; in other cases, these questions have become major open problems in computer science and mathematics.

The ubiquity of machine learning is an important factor, but just as important is the availability of software engineering data: there are billions of lines of code available in public repositories (e.g. on GitHub), there is the change history of that code, there are discussion fora (e.g. Stack Overflow) that contain a wealth of information for developers, companies have access to telemetry on their apps from millions of users, and so on. The scale of software engineering data has permitted machine learning and statistical approaches to imagine tools that are beyond the capabilities of traditional, semantics-based approaches. In this graduate seminar, students will learn the various ways in which code and related artifacts can be treated as data, and how various developer tools can be built by applying machine learning over this data. The course will consist of discussion of a selection of research papers, as well as a hands-on project that can be done in small groups. Prerequisites: Familiarity with basic machine learning, and either CS143 or CS295 .\n",

The bias causes the architecture parameters of non-learnable operations to surpass that of learnable operations. Moreover, using softmax as architecture parameters' activation function and inappropriate learning rate would exacerbate the bias. As a result, it's frequently observed that non-learnable operations are dominated in the search phase. To reduce the bias, we propose to use single-level to replace bi-level optimization and non-competitive activation function like sigmoid to replace softmax. As a result, we could search high-performance architectures steadily. Experiments on NAS Benchmark 201 validate our hypothesis and stably find out nearly the optimal architecture. On DARTS space, we search the state-of-the-art architecture with 77.0% top1 accuracy (training setting follows PDARTS and without any additional module) on ImageNet-1K and steadily search architectures up-to 76.5% top1 accuracy (but not select the best from the searched architectures) which is comparable with current reported best result.\n",

Previous studies generally update signal timings in real-time based on predefined traffic measures collected by point detectors, such as traffic volumes and occupancies. Comparing with point detectors, traffic cameras-which have been increasingly deployed on road networks-could cover larger areas and provide more detailed traffic information. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to explore the potential of traffic video data in improving the efficiency of ramp metering. The proposed method uses traffic video frames as inputs and learns the optimal control strategies directly from the high-dimensional visual inputs. A real-world case study demonstrates that, in comparison with a state-of-the-practice method, the proposed DRL method results in 1) lower travel times in the mainline, 2) shorter vehicle queues at the on-ramp, and 3) higher traffic flows downstream of the merging area. The results suggest that the proposed method is able to extract useful information from the video data for better ramp metering controls.\n",

Currently, there are three promising E2E methods: recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T), RNN attention-based encoder-decoder (AED), and Transformer-AED. In this study, we conduct an empirical comparison of RNN-T, RNN-AED, and Transformer-AED models, in both non-streaming and streaming modes. We use 65 thousand hours of Microsoft anonymized training data to train these models. As E2E models are more data hungry, it is better to compare their effectiveness with large amount of training data. To the best of our knowledge, no such comprehensive study has been conducted yet. We show that although AED models are stronger than RNN-T in the non-streaming mode, RNN-T is very competitive in streaming mode if its encoder can be properly initialized. Among all three E2E models, transformer-AED achieved the best accuracy in both streaming and non-streaming mode. We show that both streaming RNN-T and transformer-AED models can obtain better accuracy than a highly-optimized hybrid model.\n",

We apply it to the task of instance selection in distant supervision. Modeling the instance selection in one bag as a sequential decision process, a reinforcement learning agent is trained to determine whether an instance is valuable or not and construct a new bag with less noisy instances. However unbiased methods, such as REINFORCE, could usually take much time to train. This paper adopts posterior regularization (PR) to integrate some domain-specific rules in instance selection using REINFORCE.

It has many critical applications such as billing and aetiology research. The automation of clinical coding is very challenging due to data sparsity, low interoperability of digital health systems, complexity of real-life diagnosis coupled with the huge size of ICD10 code space. Related work suffer from low applicability due to reliance on many data sources, inefficient modelling and less generalizable solutions. We propose a novel collaborative residual learning based model to automatically predict ICD10 codes employing only prescriptions data. Extensive experiments were performed on two real-world clinical datasets (outpatient & inpatient) from Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital with real case-mix distributions. We obtain multi-label classification accuracy of 0.71 and 0.57 of average precision, 0.57 and 0.38 of F1-score and 0.73 and 0.44 of accuracy in predicting principal diagnosis for inpatient and outpatient datasets respectively.\n",

Recent work by Zhang et al. [2017] presents an analysis for the hitting time of SGLD for the first and second order stationary points. The proof in Zhang et al. [2017] is a two-stage procedure through bounding the Cheeger's constant, which is rather complicated and leads to loose bounds. In this paper, using intuitions from stochastic differential equations, we provide a direct analysis for the hitting times of SGLD to the first and second order stationary points. Our analysis is straightforward. It only relies on basic linear algebra and probability theory tools. Our direct analysis also leads to tighter bounds comparing to Zhang et al. [2017] and shows the explicit dependence of the hitting time on different factors, including dimensionality, smoothness, noise strength, and step size effects. Under suitable conditions, we show that the hitting time of SGLD to first-order stationary points can be dimension-independent. Moreover, we apply our analysis to study several important online estimation problems in machine learning, including linear regression, matrix factorization, and online PCA.\n",

Explainable recommendation systems, in particular, may suffer from both explanation bias and performance disparity. In this paper, we analyze different groups of users according to their level of activity, and find that bias exists in recommendation performance between different groups. We show that inactive users may be more susceptible to receiving unsatisfactory recommendations, due to insufficient training data for the inactive users, and that their recommendations may be biased by the training records of more active users, due to the nature of collaborative filtering, which leads to an unfair treatment by the system. We propose a fairness constrained approach via heuristic re-ranking to mitigate this unfairness problem in the context of explainable recommendation over knowledge graphs. We experiment on several real-world datasets with state-of-the-art knowledge graph-based explainable recommendation algorithms.

We introduce a simple paraphrase generation algorithm which discourages the production of n-grams that are present in the input. Our approach enables paraphrase generation in many languages from a single multilingual NMT model. Furthermore, the amount of lexical diversity between the input and output can be controlled at generation time. We conduct a human evaluation to compare our method to a paraphraser trained on the large English synthetic paraphrase database ParaBank 2 (Hu et al., 2019c) and find that our method produces paraphrases that better preserve meaning and are more gramatical, for the same level of lexical diversity.

At each decision epoch, the road side unit observes the global network state, allocates channels and schedules data packets for all vehicle user equipment-pairs (VUE-pairs). The decision-making procedure is modelled as a discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP). The technical challenges in solving an optimal control policy originate from highly spatial mobility of vehicles and temporal variations in data traffic. To simplify the decision-making process, we first decompose the MDP into a series of per-VUE-pair MDPs. We then propose an online long short-term memory based deep reinforcement learning algorithm to break the curse of high dimensionality in state space faced by each per-VUE-pair MDP. With the proposed algorithm, the optimal channel allocation and packet scheduling decision at each epoch can be made in a decentralized way in accordance with the partial observations of the global network state at the VUE-pairs. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis and show the effectiveness of the proposed online learning algorithm.\n",

We propose in this paper two different deep-learning-based approaches to address glaucoma detection just from raw circumpapillary OCT images.

The experiments were performed on a private database composed of 93 glaucomatous and 156 normal B-scans around the optic nerve head of the retina, which were diagnosed by expert ophthalmologists. The validation results evidence that fine-tuned CNNs outperform the networks trained from scratch when small databases are addressed.

The weights decays inverse proportionally with the iteration times. Stochastic gradient descent with momentum (Sgdm) use weights that decays exponentially with the iteration times to generate an momentum term. Using exponentially decaying weights, variants of Sgdm with well designed and complicated formats have been proposed to achieve better performance. The momentum update rules of our method is as simple as that of Sgdm. We provide theoretical convergence properties analyses for our method, which show both the exponentially decay weights and our inverse proportionally decay weights can limit the variance of the moving direction of parameters to be optimized to a region. Experimental results empirically show that our method works well with practical problems and outperforms Sgdm, and it outperforms Adam in convolutional neural networks.\n",

Their respective performance is evaluated in various acoustic conditions such as anechoic and reverberant scenarios, stationary and moving sources at several angular velocities, and with a varying number of overlapping sources.

In this paper, we approach this challenge through the following invariance principle: an agent must find a representation such that there exists an action-predictor built on top of this representation that is simultaneously optimal across all training domains. Intuitively, the resulting invariant policy enhances generalization by finding causes of successful actions. We propose a novel learning algorithm, Invariant Policy Optimization (IPO), that implements this principle and learns an invariant policy during training. We compare our approach with standard policy gradient methods and demonstrate significant improvements in generalization performance on unseen domains for linear quadratic regulator and grid-world problems, and an example where a robot must learn to open doors with varying physical properties.\n",

Convolutional neural network (CNN) is becoming the dominant approach to extract image descriptors for image retrieval. For low-power hardware implementation of image retrieval, the drawback of CNN-based feature descriptor is that it requires hundreds of megabytes of storage. To address this problem, this paper applies deep model quantization and compression to CNN in ASIC chip for image retrieval. It is demonstrated that the CNN-based features descriptor can be extracted using as few as 2-bit weights quantization to deliver a similar performance as floating-point model for image retrieval. In addition, to implement CNN in ASIC, especially for large scale images, the limited buffer size of chips should be considered. To retrieve large scale images, we propose an improved pooling strategy, region nested invariance pooling (RNIP), which uses cropped sub-images for CNN. Testing results on chip show that integrating RNIP with the proposed 2-bit CNN model compression approach is capable of retrieving large scale images.\n",

Learning latent representations of discourse is an attractive alternative to acquiring expensive labeled discourse data. Liu and Lapata (2018) propose a structured attention mechanism for text classification that derives a tree over a text, akin to an RST discourse tree. We examine this model in detail, and evaluate on additional discourse-relevant tasks and datasets, in order to assess whether the structured attention improves performance on the end task and whether it captures a text's discourse structure. We find the learned latent trees have little to no structure and instead focus on lexical cues; even after obtaining more structured trees with proposed model modifications, the trees are still far from capturing discourse structure when compared to discourse dependency trees from an existing discourse parser. Finally, ablation studies show the structured attention provides little benefit, sometimes even hurting performance.\n",

In such problems, an agent faces a sequential decision-making problem where, at every time step, it observes its state, performs an action, receives a reward and moves to a new state. An RL agent learns by trial and error a good policy (or controller) based on observations and numeric reward feedback on the previously performed action. In this chapter, we present the basic framework of RL and recall the two main families of approaches that have been developed to learn a good policy. The first one, which is value-based, consists in estimating the value of an optimal policy, value from which a policy can be recovered, while the other, called policy search, directly works in a policy space. Actor-critic methods can be seen as a policy search technique where the policy value that is learned guides the policy improvement.

We apply it to the task of instance selection in distant supervision. Modeling the instance selection in one bag as a sequential decision process, a reinforcement learning agent is trained to determine whether an instance is valuable or not and construct a new bag with less noisy instances. However unbiased methods, such as REINFORCE, could usually take much time to train. This paper adopts posterior regularization (PR) to integrate some domain-specific rules in instance selection using REINFORCE. As the experiment results show, this method remarkably improves the performance of the relation classifier trained on cleaned distant supervision dataset as well as the efficiency of the REINFORCE training.\n",

The CA-robot is designed to explore formulations in an open-ended way with no explicit optimization target. By applying the CA-robot to the study of self-propelling multicomponent oil-in-water droplets, we are able to observe an order of magnitude more variety of droplet behaviours than possible with a random parameter search and given the same budget. We demonstrate that the CA-robot enabled the discovery of a sudden and highly specific response of droplets to slight temperature changes. Six modes of self-propelled droplets motion were identified and classified using a time-temperature phase diagram and probed using a variety of techniques including NMR.

To accommodate a wide variety of products, many automated systems include multiple gripper types and/or tool changers. However, for some objects, sequential grasp failures are common: when a computed grasp fails to lift and remove the object, the bin is often left unchanged; as the sensor input is consistent, the system retries the same grasp over and over, resulting in a significant reduction in mean successful picks per hour (MPPH). Based on an empirical study of sequential failures, we characterize a class of \"sequential failure objects\" (SFOs) -- objects prone to sequential failures based on a novel taxonomy. We then propose three non-Markov picking policies that incorporate memory of past failures to modify subsequent actions. Simulation experiments on SFO models and the EGAD dataset suggest that the non-Markov policies significantly outperform the Markov policy in terms of the sequential failure rate and MPPH. In physical experiments on 50 heaps of 12 SFOs the most effective Non-Markov policy increased MPPH over the Dex-Net Markov policy by 107%.\n",

Here, we automate feature extraction of time-lapse microscopy of human embryos with a machine-learning pipeline of five convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Thus, we check whether receiving help from an expert when solving a simple close-ended task (the Towers of Hanoï) allows to accelerate or not the learning of this task, depending on whether the intervention is canonical or requested by the player.

Recent research have established the vulnerability of supervised machine learning models (e.g., classifiers) to model extraction attacks. Such attacks leverage the loosely-restricted ability of the attacker to iteratively query the model for labels, thereby allowing for the forging of a labeled dataset which can be used to train a replica of the original model. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting imitation learning techniques in launching model extraction attacks on DRL agents. Furthermore, we develop proof-of-concept attacks that leverage such techniques for black-box attacks against the integrity of DRL policies.

While it has its roots in non-monotonic logics, it can be applied to various areas in computer science, especially in explainable reasoning; its most central concept is a justification: an explanation why a property holds (or does not hold) in a model. In this paper, we continue the study of justification theory by means of three major contributions. The first is studying the relation between justification theory and game theory. We show that justification frameworks can be seen as a special type of games. The established connection provides the theoretical foundations for our next two contributions. The second contribution is studying under which condition two different dialects of justification theory (graphs as explanations vs trees as explanations) coincide. The third contribution is establishing a precise criterion of when a semantics induced by justification theory yields consistent results. In the past proving that such semantics were consistent took cumbersome and elaborate proofs. We show that these criteria are indeed satisfied for all common semantics of logic programming. This paper is under consideration for acceptance in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).\n",

Both the model fitting and hypothesis testing leverage a resampled version of the sensitive attribute obeying equalized odds, by construction. We demonstrate the applicability and validity of the proposed framework both in regression and multi-class classification problems, reporting improved performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Next, we consider the sample-inefficiency of current adversarial training techniques, and propose a novel Adversarially-Guided Exploration (AGE) mechanism based on a modified hybrid of the $ε$-greedy algorithm and Boltzmann exploration.

Even as simple algorithm as K-means fails to cluster a set of sequences using edit distance if they are of variable length and abundance. In this paper we propose a novel metric - soft edit distance (SED), which is a smooth approximation of edit distance. It is differentiable and therefore it is possible to optimize it with gradient methods. Similar to original edit distance, SED as well as its derivatives can be calculated with recurrent formulas at polynomial time. We prove usefulness of the proposed metric on synthetic datasets and clustering of biological sequences.\n",

In this work, an algorithm selection framework is employed on the NSL-KDD data set and a novel paradigm of machine learning taxonomy is presented. The framework uses a combination of user input and meta-features to select the best algorithm to detect cyber attacks on a network. Performance is compared between a rule-of-thumb strategy and a meta-learning strategy. The framework removes the conjecture of the common trial-and-error algorithm selection method. The framework recommends five algorithms from the taxonomy. Both strategies recommend a high-performing algorithm, though not the best performing.

In this paper, a prosody learning mechanism is proposed to model the prosody of speech based on TTS system, where the prosody information of speech is extracted from the melspectrum by a prosody learner and combined with the phoneme sequence to reconstruct the mel-spectrum. Meanwhile, the sematic features of text from the pre-trained language model is introduced to improve the prosody prediction results. In addition, a novel self-attention structure, named as local attention, is proposed to lift this restriction of input text length, where the relative position information of the sequence is modeled by the relative position matrices so that the position encodings is no longer needed.

Our idea is to define a discrete neighborhood of the current SGD point containing a number of \"potentially good moves\" that exploit gradient information, and to search this neighborhood by using a classical metaheuristic scheme borrowed from Discrete Optimization.\n  In the present paper we investigate the use of a simple Simulated Annealing (SA) metaheuristic that accepts/rejects a candidate new solution in the neighborhood with a probability that depends both on the new solution quality and on a parameter (the temperature) which is modified over time to lower the probability of accepting worsening moves. We use this scheme as an automatic way to perform hyper-parameter tuning, hence the title of the paper. A distinctive feature of our scheme is that hyper-parameters are modified within a single SGD execution (and not in an external loop, as customary) and evaluated on the fly on the current minibatch, i.e., their tuning is fully embedded within the SGD algorithm.\n",

To train language models for formal mathematics, we propose a novel skip-tree task.

Recently, neural networks have been augmented with behavioral data to solve a range of NLP tasks spanning syntax and semantics. We are the first to exploit neuroscientific data, namely electroencephalography (EEG), to inform a neural attention model about language processing of the human brain. The challenge in working with EEG data is that features are exceptionally rich and need extensive pre-processing to isolate signals specific to text processing. We devise a method for finding such EEG features to supervise machine attention through combining theoretically motivated cropping with random forest tree splits. After this dimensionality reduction, the pre-processed EEG features are capable of distinguishing two reading tasks retrieved from a publicly available EEG corpus. We apply these features to regularise attention on relation classification and show that EEG is more informative than strong baselines. This improvement depends on both the cognitive load of the task and the EEG frequency domain. Hence, informing neural attention models with EEG signals is beneficial but requires further investigation to understand which dimensions are the most useful across NLP tasks.\n",

SacreROUGE removes many obstacles that researchers face when using or developing metrics: (1) The library provides Python wrappers around the official implementations of existing evaluation metrics so they share a common, easy-to-use interface; (2) it provides functionality to evaluate how well any metric implemented in the library correlates to human-annotated judgments, so no additional code needs to be written for a new evaluation metric; and (3) it includes scripts for loading datasets that contain human judgments so they can easily be used for evaluation.

Explanations are challenging in that they require many different forms of abstract knowledge and reasoning. Previous work has either relied on human-curated structured knowledge bases or detailed domain representation to generate satisfactory explanations. They are also often limited to ranking pre-existing explanation choices. In our work, we contribute to the under-explored area of generating natural language explanations for general phenomena. We automatically collect large datasets of explanation-phenomenon pairs which allow us to train sequence-to-sequence models to generate natural language explanations. We compare different training strategies and evaluate their performance using both automatic scores and human ratings. We demonstrate that our strategy is sufficient to generate highly plausible explanations for general open-domain phenomena compared to other models trained on different datasets.\n",

This biases the \"narrative\" presented by the machine to the user.We address this narrative bias by introducing explanatory guided learning, a novel interactive learning strategy in which: i) the supervisor is in charge of choosing the query instances, while ii) the machine uses global explanations to illustrate its overall behavior and to guide the supervisor toward choosing challenging, informative instances.

In this paper, we explore active inference and the free energy principle, a normative theory from neuroscience that explains how self-organizing biological systems operate by maintaining a model of the world and casting action selection as an inference problem.

ESD identifies grammatically incorrect text spans with an efficient sequence tagging model.

Given a natural language description, code retrieval aims to search for the most relevant code among a set of code. Existing state-of-the-art approaches apply neural networks to code retrieval. However, these approaches still fail to capture an important feature: overlaps. The overlaps between different names used by different people indicate that two different names may be potentially related (e.g., \"message\" and \"msg\"), and the overlaps between identifiers in code and words in natural language descriptions indicate that the code snippet and the description may potentially be related. To address these problems, we propose a novel neural architecture named OCoR, where we introduce two specifically-designed components to capture overlaps: the first embeds identifiers by character to capture the overlaps between identifiers, and the second introduces a novel overlap matrix to represent the degrees of overlaps between each natural language word and each identifier.\n",

A research challenge is to learn each module with the least amount of samples (i.e., few-shots) given the high cost related to the data collection. The most common and effective technique to solve this problem is transfer learning, where large language models, either pre-trained on text or task-specific data, are fine-tuned on the few samples. These methods require fine-tuning steps and a set of parameters for each task. Differently, language models, such as GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) and GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), allow few-shot learning by priming the model with few examples. In this paper, we evaluate the priming few-shot ability of language models in the NLU, DST, DP and NLG tasks.

Our idea is to define a discrete neighborhood of the current SGD point containing a number of \"potentially good moves\" that exploit gradient information, and to search this neighborhood by using a classical metaheuristic scheme borrowed from Discrete Optimization.\n  In the present paper we investigate the use of a simple Simulated Annealing (SA) metaheuristic that accepts/rejects a candidate new solution in the neighborhood with a probability that depends both on the new solution quality and on a parameter (the temperature) which is modified over time to lower the probability of accepting worsening moves. We use this scheme as an automatic way to perform hyper-parameter tuning, hence the title of the paper. A distinctive feature of our scheme is that hyper-parameters are modified within a single SGD execution (and not in an external loop, as customary) and evaluated on the fly on the current minibatch, i.e., their tuning is fully embedded within the SGD algorithm.\n",

In this paper we find that both method types can complement each other, in the sense that, the former can exploit context information via language-independent features but sees no task-specific information in the target language; while the latter generally generates pseudo target-language training data via translation but its exploitation of context information is weakened by inaccurate translations. Moreover, prior works rarely leverage unlabeled data in the target language, which can be effortlessly collected and potentially contains valuable information for improved results. To handle both problems, we propose a novel approach termed UniTrans to Unify both model and data Transfer for cross-lingual NER, and furthermore, to leverage the available information from unlabeled target-language data via enhanced knowledge distillation. We evaluate our proposed UniTrans over 4 target languages on benchmark datasets. Our experimental results show that it substantially outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.\n",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for KG entity typing which is trained by jointly utilizing local typing knowledge from existing entity type assertions and global triple knowledge from KGs. Specifically, we present two distinct knowledge-driven effective mechanisms of entity type inference. Accordingly, we build two novel embedding models to realize the mechanisms. Afterward, a joint model with them is used to infer missing entity type instances, which favors inferences that agree with both entity type instances and triple knowledge in KGs. Experimental results on two real-world datasets (Freebase and YAGO) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanisms and models for improving KG entity typing.

Autonomous driving is a fundamental measure for solving this problem, and track detection is one of the key technologies for computer vision to achieve downhole automatic driving. The track detection result based on the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm lacks the detailed and unique description of the object and relies too much on visual postprocessing technology. Therefore, this paper proposes a track detection algorithm based on a multiscale conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). The generator is decomposed into global and local parts using a multigranularity structure in the generator network. A multiscale shared convolution structure is adopted in the discriminator network to further supervise training the generator. Finally, the Monte Carlo search technique is introduced to search the intermediate state of the generator, and the result is sent to the discriminator for comparison. Compared with the existing work, our model achieved 82.43\\% pixel accuracy and an average intersection-over-union (IOU) of 0.6218, and the detection of the track reached 95.01\\% accuracy in the downhole roadway scene test set.\n",

While these documents are generally not complete in the sense that they will not include prose content, generated by an author to provide context, a narrative, etc., programmatic generation can provide substantial efficiencies for structuring and constructing documents. This paper explores the programmatic generation of reproducible by distinguishing components than can be created by computational means from those requiring human-generated prose, providing guidelines for the generation of these documents, and identifying a use case in clinical trial reporting. These concepts and use case are illustrated through the listdown package for the R programming environment, which is is currently available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).\n",

In contrast, we humans can learn multi-lingual translations even without parallel texts by referring our languages to the external world. To mimic such human learning behavior, we employ images as pivots to enable zero-resource translation learning. However, a picture tells a thousand words, which makes multi-lingual sentences pivoted by the same image noisy as mutual translations and thus hinders the translation model learning. In this work, we propose a progressive learning approach for image-pivoted zero-resource machine translation. Since words are less diverse when grounded in the image, we first learn word-level translation with image pivots, and then progress to learn the sentence-level translation by utilizing the learned word translation to suppress noises in image-pivoted multi-lingual sentences. Experimental results on two widely used image-pivot translation datasets, IAPR-TC12 and Multi30k, show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n",

Neuromorphic architectures demonstrating such versatility can greatly enhance our ability to efficiently process information at the edge. A key challenge, however, is to understand which learning rules are best suited for specific tasks and how the relevant hyperparameters can be fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a conceptual framework in which the learning process is integrated into the network itself. This allows us to cast meta-learning as a mathematical optimization problem. We employ DeepHyper, a scalable, asynchronous model-based search, to simultaneously optimize the choice of meta-learning rules and their hyperparameters. We demonstrate our approach with two different datasets, MNIST and FashionMNIST, using a network architecture inspired by the learning center of the insect brain. Our results show that optimal learning rules can be dataset-dependent even within similar tasks.

Experiments on WebNLG datasets show that our unsupervised model trained on the same number of data achieves performance on par with several fully supervised models. Further experiments on the non-parallel GenWiki dataset verify that our method performs the best among unsupervised baselines.

However, while most sequence labeling models do not consider such label components, the shared components across labels, such as Person, can be beneficial for label prediction.

We also apply a distance-aware graph attention algorithm with gate augmentation to increase the performance of our model. As a result, our model shows better performance than docking and other deep learning methods for both virtual screening and pose prediction.

One question arises from this: how to train an end-to-end SLU with limited amounts of data? Many researchers have explored approaches that make use of other related data resources, typically by pre-training parts of the model on high-resource speech recognition. In this paper, we suggest improving the generalization performance of SLU models with a non-standard learning algorithm, Reptile. Though Reptile was originally proposed for model-agnostic meta learning, we argue that it can also be used to directly learn a target task and result in better generalization than conventional gradient descent. In this work, we employ Reptile to the task of end-to-end spoken intent classification. Experiments on four datasets of different languages and domains show improvement of intent prediction accuracy, both when Reptile is used alone and used in addition to pre-training.\n",

Therefore, \\textit{a priori} knowledge of faults that may occur in the system is not required. The adaptive scheme combines online and offline learning of the on-policy control method to improve exploration and sample efficiency, while guaranteeing stable learning.

In 2002 Holling and colleagues proposed the concept of Panarchy, which presented social-ecological systems as an interacting set of adaptive cycles, each of which is produced by the dynamic tensions between novelty and efficiency at multiple scales.

Almost twenty years after this concept was introduced we review how it has been used, tested, extended and revised. We do this by combining qualitative methods and machine learning.

Learning Node Representations that Capture Multiple Social Contexts\n\nRecent interest in graph embedding methods has focused on learning a single representation for each node in the graph. But can nodes really be best described by a single vector representation? In this work, we propose a method for learning multiple representations of the nodes in a graph (e.g., the users of a social network). Based on a principled decomposition of the ego-network, each representation encodes the role of the node in a different local community in which the nodes participate. These representations allow for improved reconstruction of the nuanced relationships that occur in the graph -- a phenomenon that we illustrate through state-of-the-art results on link prediction tasks on a variety of graphs, reducing the error by up to $90\\%$.

Their 'black box' way of classifying medical images into anomaly labels poses problems for their acceptance, particularly with clinicians. Current explainable AI methods offer justifications through visualizations such as heat maps but cannot guarantee that the network is focusing on the relevant image region fully containing the anomaly. In this paper, we develop an approach to explainable AI in which the anomaly is assured to be overlapping the expected location when present. This is made possible by automatically extracting location-specific labels from textual reports and learning the association of expected locations to labels using a hybrid combination of Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (Bi-LSTM) and DenseNet-121. Use of this expected location to bias the subsequent attention-guided inference network based on ResNet101 results in the isolation of the anomaly at the expected location when present.

It is not scalable to develop a new centralized agent every time a task's difficulty outpaces a single agent's abilities. While multi-agent collaboration research has flourished in gridworld-like environments, relatively little work has considered visually rich domains. Addressing this, we introduce the novel task FurnMove in which agents work together to move a piece of furniture through a living room to a goal. Unlike existing tasks, FurnMove requires agents to coordinate at every timestep. We identify two challenges when training agents to complete FurnMove: existing decentralized action sampling procedures do not permit expressive joint action policies and, in tasks requiring close coordination, the number of failed actions dominates successful actions. To confront these challenges we introduce SYNC-policies (synchronize your actions coherently) and CORDIAL (coordination loss). Using SYNC-policies and CORDIAL, our agents achieve a 58% completion rate on FurnMove, an impressive absolute gain of 25 percentage points over competitive decentralized baselines.

Headline CPI increased at a 1.9 percent annualized rate from January through July. Under the hood, there has been a shift in relative prices. Core goods (which exclude food and energy) inflation has risen modestly, which has been more than offset by a decline in services inflation. Some commentators have been quick to attribute the increase in goods inflation to trade policy. However, placing the increase in an international context highlights the following facts:\nCore goods inflation has increased globally over the past 12 months.\nEven with the increase, core goods inflation in the United States remains at a low level (1.2 percent over the 12 months through July and 1.1 percent annualized since January). It’s also lower than in other countries.\n",

Trump’s bold, decisive action against Iran — the world’s\nleading\nstate sponsor of terrorism — and its key nuclear facilities was met with bipartisan praise from lawmakers across Capitol Hill.\nHere’s what they’re saying:\nSpeaker Mike Johnson\n: “The President made the right call, and did what he needed to do. Leaders in Congress were aware of the urgency of this situation and the Commander-in-Chief evaluated that the imminent danger outweighed the time it would take for Congress to act. The world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, which chants ‘Death to America,’ simply could not be allowed the opportunity to obtain and use nuclear weapons. The President fully respects the Article I power of Congress, and tonight’s necessary, limited, and targeted strike follows the history and tradition of similar military actions under presidents of both parties.”\n",
